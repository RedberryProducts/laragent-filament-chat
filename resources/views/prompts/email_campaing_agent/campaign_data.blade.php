# Redberry Hackathon Announcement

## 👉 Registration is open!

On June 21-22, at Redberry, an AI Agent-themed hackathon will be held, where participation is open to all Redberry employees.

Within the framework of the hackathon, teams will receive a specific brief and around it will create a product prototype, which they will present at the end of the event in the format of a presentation.

After the presentations are over, the jury will evaluate the works and will reveal the winning team and idea of the hackathon.

## What is a hackathon

A hackathon is a several-day event, in which anyone can participate - developers, product owners, designers, project managers, and just people with many creative ideas.

The goal of the hackathon is:

    to gather teams together and quickly turn creative ideas into prototypes

    to create the perfect space for learning and for getting to know new directions in technology

    to strengthen teamwork skills

    simply to have fun, work with new people and enjoy the process 🚀

### Why it's worth participating:

✅ Educational and entertaining weekend

✅ Real work experience in creating AI Agents

✅ Chance to win and receive prizes

✅ Meeting new people and discovering new ideas

## What does AI Agent mean in the hackathon?

AI Agent in the hackathon means that, as a team, you need to create a "smart agent", which will perform a specific task automatically or semi-automatically.

An AI Agent can be:

🤖 Chat, which answers questions and performs actions

🤖 A background-running system, which processes data and makes decisions

🤖 A bot, which integrates with other systems (for example: CRM, Slack, Email) and performs actions there

### That means your goal will be:

👉 Think of an idea — what kind of "smart agent" to create

👉 Build the prototype — use LarAgent + AI models

👉 Present the result — at the end of the hackathon we will have presentations 🚀


# What is an AI Agent?

AI Agents are software systems that use artificial intelligence to achieve goals and perform tasks on behalf of the user.

They are often characterized by reasoning, planning, and memory, and also have a certain autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt to the environment.

## What does an AI Agent look like?

An AI Agent can have various forms - chat, background system, application, bot, workflow, etc.

It depends only on your need - what should trigger the AI Agent?

For example, in chat, it's a user's message that triggers it, in a background system it might be some event or simply a scheduler: "trigger every hour."

In case of an application, the trigger might be a new user registration or simply a button clicked by the user.

In this document, we will provide examples from its most well-known and classic form - chat.

## How does an AI Agent differ from an LLM?

Traditional “conversational” AI (LLM) has certain limitations - it can tell you the history of the world or plan your next day based on the information you provide, but it cannot simply check your calendar and find out when you are free. That is, it cannot get information from the environment.

Also, within the chat, it may change behavior based on your request, but in a new chat it will act the same as before, meaning it cannot adapt.

You can ask it to write a message, then copy it into your email app and send it, because it cannot act on your behalf.

An AI Agent is an LLM + tools, which eliminate these limitations, more specifically:

    Getting information from the environment: the ability to independently get live information - not only search (although search is one example), but also read emails, understand dates and time, read tasks in Jira, look into documentation, read documents from Drive, etc.

    Feedback Loop: an adaptation mechanism, that is, something that allows the agent to perform its task better each time. For example, if your agent’s job is writing posts, you can add a “like” button and save liked posts in its memory as “good examples”

    Tools: a set of actions that the agent can perform. Theoretically, anything you can do on the internet, the agent can do too (if the proper API exists), whether it's sending an email or online shopping.

These characteristics make an LLM agentic, and the more of these features a system has, the more agent-like it is considered.
